# Expense Tracker

An expense tracking web application to help users manage their monthly budget, track their expenses, and set a budget limit. The application allows users to add, view, and delete expenses while providing insights into their spending behavior.

## Features

- **Set Budget:** Users can set a monthly budget.
- **Track Expenses:** Users can log expenses with categories, amounts, dates, and descriptions.
- **View Expenses:** Expenses can be viewed by category or on a monthly basis.
- **Delete Expenses:** Users can remove any expense from their list.
- **Warning Alerts:** Alerts the user if they exceed their set budget.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML5, CSS3
  - JavaScript (for dynamic behaviors)
  - Bootstrap (optional for styling)
- **Backend:**
  - Python (Flask)
- **Database:**
  - SQLite (for storing expenses and budget)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.x or later)
- Flask (install via `pip install flask`)
- SQLite (pre-installed with Python)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file includes the necessary libraries like Flask, and any additional dependencies for your project.

### Configure the Application

1. **Database Setup:**
   - The application uses SQLite for storing expenses. Make sure to initialize the database by running:

   ```bash
   python init_db.py
   ```

   This script creates the necessary database file (`expenses.db`).

2. **Run the Application:**

   To run the Flask app locally, use the following command:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The application will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default.

### Project Flow

1. **Homepage (`/`)**
   - Displays the current monthly budget and total expenses.
   - Users can add, view, and delete expenses.

2. **Add Expense (`/add-expense`)**
   - A form to input new expenses (category, amount, description, date).
   
3. **Set Budget (`/set-budget`)**
   - Allows users to set or update their monthly budget.

4. **View Options (`/view-options`)**
   - Allows users to view their expenses filtered by category or month.

## Customization

You can customize the following:

- **Expense Categories:** The application can be updated with more categories in the `app.py` file.
- **Styling:** Modify the `styles.css` file for any additional or custom styling.
